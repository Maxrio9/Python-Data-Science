    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this data is to analyze biodiversity data from the National Park Service, especially the various species, the numbers observed at different national parks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will scope, analyze, prepare, plot data and seek to explain the findings from the analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "A few questions this project seeks to answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?\n",
    "- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?\n",
    "- Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?\n",
    "- What animal is most prevelent and what is their distribution amongst parks?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data sources:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `observations.csv` and `Species_info.csv` was provided by [Codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this project is *inspired* by real data, but is mostly fictional."

    "## Scoping\n",
    "\n",
    "It's beneficial to establish the scope of the project at the beginning. The following four sections are to help guide the process and progress. The first will set the high level objectives and intentions. In the next data section we have to look at the data to establish if we can reach the goals of the project. Thirdly, we have to review the methods and questions and if they are aligned with the project goals. Lastly, we have to draw conclusions and describe findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "The perspective is a biodiversity analyst for the National Park Service. The National Parks Service wants to ensure the survival of at-risk species, to maintain the level of biodiversity in their parks. Therefore, the main objective as a data analyst will be to understand the characteristics of species and their conservation status, and those species and their relationsship to the national park. Some questions to pose:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?\n",
    "- Are there certain types of species more likely to be endangered?\n",
    "- Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?\n",
    "- What animal is most prevelent and what is their distribution amongst parks?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This project had two datasets provided. One `csv` with the species, their category, scientific name, common name and conservation status; The other with the number of individuals observed by scientific name and the National Park where they were observed. This data will be used to analyse the goals of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, descriptive statistics and data visulization techniques will be employed to understand the data better. Statistical inference will also be used to see if the observed values are statistically significant. Some of the key metrics that will be computed include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Distributions\n",
    "2. Counts\n",
    "3. Relationships between species\n",
    "4. Conservation status of species\n",
    "5. Observations of species in parks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly it's a good idea to revisit the goals and check if the output of the analysis corresponds to the questions first set to be answered. This section will also reflect on what has been learned in the process, and if any of the questions were unable to be answered. This could also include limitations or if any of the analysis could have been done with different methodologies."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was able to make several data visualizations and inferences about the various species in the four National Parks that comprised this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was also able to answer some of the questions first posed in the beginning:\n",
    "- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?\n",
    "  - While most species aren't endangered, 191 of 5541 were\n",
    "- Are there certain types of species more likely to be endangered?\n",
    "  - Yes, mammals and birds were a lot more likely to be endangered than plants\n",
    "- Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?\n",
    "  - While the difference between mammals and birds isn't significant, the difference between raptiles and mammals was\n",
    "- What animal is most prevelent and what is their distribution amongst parks?\n",
    "  - Bats are the most common with most of them being found in Yellowstone National Park and fewest of them in Great Smoky Mountains National Park"

    "## Further Research\n",
    "\n",
    "With more datasets over time we would be able to see the change in population over time and if certain species are increasing or decreasing in population. We might also add seasonal changes in sightings by species or category.\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of the national parks isn't mentioned. This means we don't know if Yellowstone National Park is much larger than Great Smoky Mountains National Park and therefore if it exhibits greater biodiversity and species populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly coordinates of sightings might be interesting to see possible clustering of sighting in various areas or the movement over time of these species."
